In the first practical work I created a profile card page, which contains basic infromation about me.

I used the following tailwind components template: https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/profile-page

Background, text and border colors were set using inner style tag in the head of the html document.

All the rest of the styles were provided by the template and are implemented by using tailwind framework.

All the data is now static and hardcoded in the index.html file.
